## Description
Program to automatically add Mobile Guard Authenticator to Steam accounts.

If you want a program to create steam accounts check the project [SteamAccountCreateHelper](https://github.com/Cappi1998/SteamAccountCreateHelper).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
[.NET Core 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or higher required. 

- Run the program for the first time to create the configuration files.
- Configure the "Config.json" file.


### Config.json
- <a href="#AccountsFormatInput">AccountsFormatInput</a> => input format of accounts that will be processed. you can use "SteamAccountCreateHelper" or "login:pass:email:emailpass"
- <a href="#PhoneServiceToUse">PhoneServiceToUse</a> => Phone Service that will be used to obtain rental numbers.
- PhoneServiceApiKey => API Key for the chosen Phone Service.
- AccountsPerNumber => number(int) of accounts to be linked in each number.
- Country => check <a href="#PhoneServiceToUse">PhoneServiceToUse</a> to find out how to get the country code

## AccountsFormatInput
- "SteamAccountCreateHelper" - for accounts made using the program [SteamAccountCreateHelper](https://github.com/Cappi1998/SteamAccountCreateHelper), you need to put the accounts' .txt files in the folder Database/Accounts_ToAdded_Guard.
- "login:pass:email:emailpass" - you need to put the accounts in `Accounts_ToAdded_Guard.txt` inside the Database/ folder.

## PhoneServiceToUse
- "sms-activate.ru" - I checked the desired Country Code [here](https://sms-activate.ru/en/api2).
- "cheapsms.ru" - Config.Country doesn't matter.
